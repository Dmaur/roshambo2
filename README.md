# roshambo2

I had to cut my losses and start over. My first attempt had all my code tangled. unorganized mess. All the struggling helped me see a bunch of stuff that didnt work. This second try i feel like im laying a much better foundation. Supprisingly it doesn't feel too bad. I like how this second attempt is turning out much better. Here is to the first commit/push of a fresh start.
